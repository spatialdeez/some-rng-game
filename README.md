# some-rng-game
Hello! Thank you for downloading my Python game. After a few gruelling weeks of trying to piece everything up, I have made my own Python game for all of you to try!

CURRENT VERSION: 0.0.1 (alpha)

# INSTALLATION PROCESS (IMPORTANT)

You need to download these files in order to run the code:

# Latest Python Version (15/12/2024): https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.13.1/python-3.13.1-amd64.exe
You can head to python.org to get the latest version if this is not updated

# pip installed (this is the troublesome part)
https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_download/

read the documentation, or you can watch this video:

after you got pip installed, go to your command prompt/terminal and run this:
python3 -m pip install -U pygame==2.6.0

Now, all you have to do is fire up the IDLE (quick search on windows and spotlight on macOS), click file, open file, click on the game folder and run the file, main.py, and you are set!
